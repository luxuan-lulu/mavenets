    Trains a Tuner-enable model using a variety of options. Training is automatically
    stops if no improvement in the validation loss is seen, compiles functions where
    possible, downgrades precision, and generates reports of loss trends during 
    training.

    Arguments:
    ---------
    model:
        Model that will be optimized. Must be a MHTuner instance, not just a nn.Module.
    optimizer:
        torch.optim optimizer instance. Must already be initialized.
    device:
        Device to train on; likely "cpu" or "cuda".
    n_epochs:
        Maximum number of epochs to train for. If no improvement in the validation loss
        is observed over a given time frame (see patience argument), training
        may be halted before reading this number of epochs.
    train_dataset:
        Validation dataset. If graph is True, should be serve pyg Data objects with
        x, y, and experiment attributes. Else, should return
        (features, signal, experiment) tuples.
    valid_dataset:
        Validation dataset. If graph is True, should be serve pyg Data objects with
        x, y, and experiment attributes. Else, should return
        (features, signal, experiment) tuples.
    report_datasets:
        A dictionary of datasets that are evaluated using the model each time an entry
        is added to the report. Adding datasets via this argument is only needed if
        tracking the loss over multiple datasets is desired. Loss values on these 
        datasets do not affect early stopping.
    train_loss_function:
        Train loss function to use. Must be a parameterized loss: should map
        three arguments (guess, reference, parameter) to a scalar tensor.
        This is likely an instance of mixed_MSE.
    report_loss_function:
        Train loss function to use. Must be a parameterized loss: should map
        three arguments (guess, reference, parameter) to a scalar tensor.
        This is likely an instance of mixed_MSE.
    train_batch_size:
        Batch size for training.
    reporting_batch_size:
        Batch size for reporting losses.
    report_stride:
        Loss reporting is done at intevals of this size. E.g., if 5, we report losses
        every 5 epochs. Larger values result in faster training, but less information.
    compile:
        Whether to compile the train and eval calls.
    compile_mode:
        Passed to torch.compile if compile is True.
    train_bfloat16:
        Whether to run forward pass in bfloat16 precision. May not be supported on all
        GPUs.
    start_loss_param:
        Optimization is performed using a loss change changes during training by passing
        a control parameter. This parameter starts at start_loss_param and linearly
        ramps down to end_loss_param over loss_param_ramp_size epochs; after this ramp,
        the parameter stays at end_loss for the remainder of training.
    end_loss_param:
        See start_loss_param.
    loss_param_ramp_size:
        See start_loss_param.
    grad_clip:
        Grad norm to clip at. Lower this is training all of a sudden becomes unstable.
    progress_bar:
        Whether to show a tqdm progress bar updating every epoch.
    patience:
        Training is terminated one the (non-smoothed) validation loss has not improved
        for this many updates (not epochs--- epochs*report_stride).
    graph:
        Treats model as a torch geometric graph neural network. Effectively, if
        model take torch_geometric Data objects as input, this must be True. Changes
        how models are wrapped and objects used for data loading.
    trainval_aware_optimizer:
        If true, we call .train() and and .eval() on the optimizer during training. This
        is only possible for some optimizers, such as those from schedulefree. If you
        don't know what this means, you can probably set this to False.

    Returns:
    -------
    3-Tuple: First element is the epoch where the optimal validation loss is found
    after smoothing data with 3-item rolling median, second element is the smoothed
    loss at that epoch, and third is a pd.DataFrame containing logged training and
    validation losses.
